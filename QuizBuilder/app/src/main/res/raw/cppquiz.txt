This is the automatic reclamation (deterministically or non-deterministically) of memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced (being used).$$Garbage Collection
What type of garbage collection does C++ employ?$$deterministically
You would use this if an object is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object, where the base-class destructor function (matching the pointer type) is called on the object, not the destructor most appropriate to the class being destroyed.$$Virtual destructor
When an object is created, its state can be initialized by this type of method. In most object-oriented languages, this method would have the same name as the class and would be created automatically if the programmer did not create one.$$Initialization Section
This is the “blueprint” for an object. It is the code that defines an object, and all objects are created (instanced) based on this. It is an abstraction of a real-world concept, and it provides the basis from which we create instances of specific objects.$$Class
This is the concept that a new class can be based on an existing class. This is done by extending (adding to) these behaviors from the existing class through a process known as sub classing or generalization.$$Inheritance
This is when we include objects as instance variables (members) of other classes.$$Composition
The C++ Standard Library class template vector is used to create?$$Vector
array<int,5>myArray={1,2,3,4,5}; is an example of the use of what?$$Initializer
An array is a contiguous group of memory locations that all have the same type. To refer to a single storage location of an array we refer to its name and _________ (see below) in square brackets.$$Index/subscript
